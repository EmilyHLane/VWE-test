We have a PHP file that returns a JSON array. 
I'd like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the JSON data and display it in an organized manner. 
In addition, I'd like to see a sorting mechanic on the front-end. 
Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task.

QUESTIONS

Is there any data that should not be displayed?
Itâ€™s totally up to you! Feel free to take a look at some wine sites for examples of what might be good to display.

What is the most important data to display?
I would say vintage, varietal, appellation and price.

What does the key "active" mean?
In our system 0 means inactive, 1 means active (live on the site).

Do you have a preference for how to sort? I was thinking by varietal and then by price.
Varietal then price sounds perfect.

Any preferences for how to visually organize or group the products?
No preference. Feel free to get creative with it, or you can check out one of our existing sites and snag the display.
